# ble113-ota-ios

## This project is no longer maintained as the BLE113 is a "legacy" product for Silicon Labs

Firmware and iOS code to have Over-The-Air updates to the BLE113 (or any Bluegiga Bluetooth device)

Please refer to http://www.sureshjoshi.com/embedded/ble113-ota-over-the-air-programming/ for a quick summary.

NOTE: Due to my disdain of the Objective C language, I'm only going to be maintaining the Swift version of this code - the Objective C version is only staying in there for a reference and for people who are already using it.
